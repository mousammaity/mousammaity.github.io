									<p>The detection and characterization of exoplanets have been one of
										the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields of astrophysics in recent
										years. One of the most effective methods for detecting exoplanets
										is the transit method, where the planet passes in front of its host
										star, causing a temporary decrease in the star's brightness. The depth
										and duration of the transit allow us to determine the size and orbital
										period of the planet, as well as its distance from the host star.
										Exoplanet transit observations have proven to be a valuable method for detecting and characterizing exoplanets. We have analyzed the light curve to determine the planet's radius,
									orbital period, and inclination from our own observation.

									<p>More than 5000 planets have been discovered orbiting other stars outside our solar system in the last two decades. Going beyond discovering more such planets, 
										the recent focus of the astronomy community is to attempt to study the atmosphere of those exoplanets. A large population (more than 70%) of Galactic M dwarfs 
										represent a complete archaeological record of the chemical evolution and star formation history of the Milky Way.

								</div>

							<div  style="width: 100%; height: 300px;">
								<p>Because of their proximity, small size, and 
									low mass, M dwarfs are becoming attractive targets for exoplanets searches and have been recently established as favourable targets for searches of small rocky 
									exoplanets and in-depth studies of their atmospheres. </p>
								
								<p>The scope of this work is to understand and analyse the atmosphere of extra-solar planets 
									like warm Neptunes using multiwavelength transits in the optical to near-infrared wavelengths. We can identify and propose possible detection of chemical species 
									in atmospheres of such types of planets from our observations, including archival data, comparing with previous published results and interpretation of scientific 
									results. Thus characterizing the atmosphere of these planets offers a path to test and improve models of planet formation and evolution, as well as habitability.

									<p>The VaTEST project was initiated at the beginning of May 2022 by Priyashkumar Mistry and Georgios Lekkas under the guidance of Dr. Kamlesh Pathak. 
										This project's objective is to validate exoplanet signals by utilizing statistical tools and probabilistic algorithms in conjunction with other 
										Python packages for the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data. More about this is available on the team webpage: 
										<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/project-vatest/home?authuser=0" target="_blank" style="color: dodgerblue;">VaTEST</a>

								<p>The work that will be done in the future on this project will be focused 
									on the bulk validation of unconfirmed exoplanets. This will be accomplished through the use of a variety of statistical validation, false alarm and 
									false positive diagnostics tests, as well as photometric and spectroscopic data analysis to calculate the exoplanet properties.

									<p>Planets from the Solar System like Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, have very dynamic and complex

										advances in the optical capabilities of telescopes. In particular, modern Cloud Tracking techniques
										allow for the compilation of the collected data in wind maps that help us understand the global wind
										circulation of a planet. We explored the atmosphere dynamics of different
										Solar System planets, applying Cloud Tracking methods to data obtained with terrestrial telescopes
										such as ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), in Chile, or during space missions such as NASAâ€™s
										Cassini-Huygens.

							<h2>HoT Jupiter Atmosphere with PLATON</h2>

									<p>More than four thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars outside our solar
										system in the last two decades. Going beyond discovering more such planets the recent focus of the
										astronomy community is to attempt to study the atmosphere of those exoplanets. We studied atmospheric characteristics
										using a publicly available and computationally efficient software named PLanetary Atmospheric
										Transmission for Observer Noobs (PLATON), which calculates transmission spectra for exoplanets
										and extracts atmospheric characteristics based on their observed spectra.

								</div>  
							</div>  
							<div  style="width: 100%; height: 300px;">
								<p>Using PLATON, we have
									studied the dependence of transit spectra on the radius of the parent star, mass and radius of the
									planet, and atmospheric pressure, temperature and composition of the planet. Then we have
									determined the absorption signature of various chemical species, such as, sodium, water, ammonia,
									methane, carbon dioxide, and several others by simulating transit spectra using PLATON. We studied
									how the absorption signature of a given species changes due to a change of the abundance of that and
									other species as well as the atmospheric temperature. Finally, we have retrieved the planetary and
									atmospheric parameters of two exoplanets from published data.</p>>
